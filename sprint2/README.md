## Sprint 2 Readme

Martian will be in charge of deployment.

We'll implement a profile page for the GraphQL group.

the three pages we identified are:
1. Home Page (display monthly top data)
2. Login Page (will show random group data below the login box)
3. Profile Page (will display specific repo group data on their respective profile)

We'll be using the repo groups to display the data so that the user may more fully understand the repositories

We are planning to all meet up on Wednesday to implement the profile page
